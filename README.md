# First-team-project
This project was my first attempt at a group project within my first Game Design class. We were tasked with making a dungeon crawler which eventually led to the game’s title “Fungeon”. Our professor gave us a three-week timetable and we started with nothing outside of the game idea. Over the next few weeks we worked as a group of five to develop a dungeon crawler in GameMaker Studios2. My main task was to produce the sound effects and music for the game. My secondary task was to assist with character design and do my share of coding. The primary goal of the project was to create a multi-leveled dungeon crawler with a secondary goal of having power-ups. When you begin the game, you are the main character roller skating in the 2D dungeon. You must shoot the ghosts to defeat them then break down the doors and proceed until you reach the boss room. Once in the boss room you have to defeat the boss that gets incrementally tougher and spawns additional enemies until you win.
